## Missing folders for new systems (DevilutionX & REminiscence)

Some roms folders are missing for new systems on the latest 6.2. You need to create them manually if you want to use them.\
For DevilutionX > create a folder `\roms\devilutionx\`.\
For REminiscence > create a folder `\roms\reminiscence\`.



## Clean es\_input file

If your controller settings become messed-up and you need a clean start, here is a `es_input.cfg` file that you can copy in your `retrobat\emulationstation\.emulationstation` folder.

It contains only standard keyboard settings, you will have to perform again your controller configuration.
