## Clean es\_input file

If your controller settings become messed-up and you need a clean start, here is a `es_input.cfg` file that you can copy in your `retrobat\emulationstation\.emulationstation` folder.

It contains only standard keyboard settings, you will have to perform again your controller configuration.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/es_input.cfg" %}

## PSP black screen when loading content with lr-ppsspp

The Libretro-ppsspp core for PSP is not compatible with the rewind functionality, disable "REWIND" and it should function properly.
